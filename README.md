# ImageComposition
## Introduction
This is a Parallel Computing course assignment that is meant to show how parallel code runs faster than sequential code.
For this, we use an image composition algorithm that uses alpha composition to overlay an image with transparency over a background image.
## Usage
You can run the code as-is from this repository. If you want to change the image files or the parameters you can refer to the "Parameters" section in the main function
